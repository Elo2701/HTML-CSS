# HTML-CSS
HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language, html is used for creating websites. Most tech people refer html as a skeleton because it does not make decorations it needs help from CSS to make decorations nor make the website function where it needs javascript to make the website fuction.HTML is not case sensitive but we prefer structure of the html code to be written in capital lettters and content in both capital letters and small letters.
In text formating we have to types of tags known as opening tag and closing tag. HTML contain element components known as opening tag,content,and closing tag.HTML has text types known as bold, italic, strong,underline,subscription,superscription, etc. Subscript is used to write che  e.g H2O, and Superscript is used to write in powers e.g 2^3.HTML headlines known as h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,and h6 have different size , h1 is the largest and h6 is the smallest.In paragraphs we have no p1,p2,p3,p4,p5,p6 we only use p.HTML listing only contains 3 elements known as ordered list where list will be numbered, unordered list where list will be in bullet form and definition list where list will be defining term, defining descrition or defifining the list.
HTML QUOTES: there is a difference between q and blockqoute, q is for content(sensentence) to be written inside double qoutes and blockqoutes is for adding space before the sentence.
HTML pre,br,code: br is used to break the content to a new line, it only contains opening tag. Elements that contains opening tag only are refered to self closing tag/void elements.Pre is used to define the block of preformatted text which preserves the text spaces, br,and other formatting characters that are ignored by the web browsers.
Creating Links: Use the <a> element (anchor) with the href attribute specifying the link's destination URL.
Place text, images, or other content between the opening and closing <a> tags to make them clickable.
URL Types:Absolute URLs: Include the entire web address (e.g., https://example.com).
HTTPS vs. HTTP: HTTPS provides better security and is recommended.
Links can be inline or wrapped around various elements.
URLs can be more complex than just the basic format
